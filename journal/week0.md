### Installing AWS CLI
- [AWS CLI Installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-linux.html)
- I had WSL installed on my machine, so I installed the AWS CLI on WSL. I also installed the AWS CLI on my Windows machine.
```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```
- I was managing multiple AWS accounts, so I used a tool called Leapp (https://docs.leapp.cloud/latest/installation/install-leapp/) to manage automatic switching between AWS accounts.
